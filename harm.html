              <ul> 
                <li> Manufacturers and companies often design electronics with a short and limited lifespan to essentially force customers to buy new models/designs of their product more frequently which not only increases e-waste but it increases the demand for raw materials, electricity, and much more further degrading the environment.  </li> 
                <li> In addition to the short lifespan of electronics companies are constantly urging their customers to buy the newest product because of a "new" design, or feature, or just because it is a new product which leads to a faster turnover of devices which is an environmental loss because of the costs that come with producing, using, and disposing the new devices.  </li>

                <h2> Excessive Energy Consumption & Carbon Emissions </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Electronics require some type of electricity to operate, whether it is through charging, direct outlet use, or battery electricity and a large amount of electricity is generated through fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions which can build up over time such as if the device (more often computers) is left on or in idle mode for long periods. </li>
                    <li> Data centers and servers also rely on electricity to operate, and since they rely on such large amounts to store and process the data they are a large contributor to carbon emissions and excessive energy consumption. </li>

                <h2> Packaging Wastes </h2>
                <ul> 
                    <li>  When packaging devices for shipment large amounts of plastics, styrofoam, and various other non-biodegradable materials are used to pack. After unpacking the user throws away the material which takes hundreds of years to break down often landing in landfills or oceans. </li>
                    <li> There is also an increase in plastic pollution which is one of the largest environmental roadblocks. It is almost crucial for companies to use excessive amounts of plastic in their packaging, which contributes to the ongoing problem of plastic pollution and its negative effects on marine life and ecosystems.  </li>
                    <li> Air pollution. When we dispose of our electronics it releases harmful chemicals on its own, but in many areas of the world such as Ghana, China, and Kenya e-waste is burnt to retrieve metals, recyclable materials, and much more.  </li>
