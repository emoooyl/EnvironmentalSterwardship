              <ul> 
                <li> Manufacturers and companies often design electronics with a short and limited lifespan to essentially force customers to buy new models/designs of their product more frequently which not only increases e-waste but it increases the demand for raw materials, electricity, and much more further degrading the environment.  </li> 
                <li> In addition to the short lifespan of electronics companies are constantly urging their customers to buy the newest product because of a "new" design, or feature, or just because it is a new product which leads to a faster turnover of devices which is an environmental loss because of the costs that come with producing, using, and disposing the new devices.  </li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Electronics require some type of electricity to operate, whether it is through charging, direct outlet use, or battery electricity and a large amount of electricity is generated through fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions which can build up over time such as if the device (more often computers) is left on or in idle mode for long periods. </li>
                    <li> Data centers and servers also rely on electricity to operate, and since they rely on such large amounts to store and process the data they are a large contributor to carbon emissions and excessive energy consumption. </li>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Mining for raw materials often requires large amounts of land, meaning that the area must be cleared. This destroys ecosystems, and habitats, and adds to biodiversity loss. The species that live in these areas are often put in situations where they are in danger, death, or displaced. </li>
                    <li> Mining and construction in these areas often lead to soil erosion, fragmentation, contamination, and various other effects, endangering plant and animal life by making it difficult to survive and thrive. </li>
                    <li> Pollutants and contamination from mining, manufacturing and construction are a threat to wildlife affects their habitats and food sources which leads to sickness, population decline, and risk for extinction. </li>
