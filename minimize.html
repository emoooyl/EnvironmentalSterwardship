                <ul> 
                    <li> Technology companies can introduce "take-back" programs to their customers which allows them to return their device for recycling or refurbishment in return for a discount on a newer model, or in-store credit. This ensures that the device or the parts are recycled to make new ones or handed down to a new customer. </li>
                    <li> Manufactures can establish "closed-loop" recycling programs where the materials from old devices are recycled and reused to make new ones. This ensures that devices with components that are still good quality can be reused instead of leaving it as a one-use part.  </li>
