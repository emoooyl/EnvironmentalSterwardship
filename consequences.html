                <li> When working in manufacturing factories the workers are often exposed to various toxic chemicals and fumes which lead to serious health issues, such as respiratory issues, skin disorders, and cancer. </li>
                <li> Production factories release many fumes that are not only a threat to the workers but to the general public over long periods of time. Factories can release fumes such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and different types of matter into the air which can contribute to air pollution, acid rain, and various health issues to surrounding communities. </li>
