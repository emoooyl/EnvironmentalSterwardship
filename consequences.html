              <h2> High Energy Consumption </h2>
              <ul> 
                <li> Manufacturing a single computer requires hundreds of kilowatt-hours of electricity, much of which comes from fossil fuels. </li> 
                <li> Energy-intensive process such as chip manufacturing and the transportation of materials and components contribute to a large carbon footprint. </li>
               </ul>
                <hr> 
                <h2> Environmental Justice Concerns </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Pollution in low-income/developing areas. Many manufacturing factories are located in low-income or developing areas where regulations regarding the environment are less strict but this leads to environmental degradation and health issues within the community. </li>
                    <li> In developing areas that are rich in resources such as parts of South America or Africa are rich in resources but ar exploited for their minerals and resources. The communities in the area get little to no economic benefit while they endure the environmental and health costs of mining, manufacturing, and construction.</li>
              </ul>
              <hr>
                <h2> Ecosystem and Biodiversity Destruction </h2>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Mining for raw materials often requires large amounts of land, meaning that the area must be cleared. This destroys ecosystems, and habitats, and adds to biodiversity loss. The species that live in these areas are often put in situations where they are in danger, death, or displaced. </li>
                    <li> Mining and construction in these areas often lead to soil erosion, fragmentation, contamination, and various other effects, endangering plant and animal life by making it difficult to survive and thrive. </li>
                    <li> Pollutants and contamination from mining, manufacturing and construction are a threat to wildlife affects their habitats and food sources which leads to sickness, population decline, and risk for extinction. </li>
