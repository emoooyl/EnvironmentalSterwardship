              <h2> Repurposing/Recycling Old Devices </h2>
              <ul> 
                <li>We all know the common saying "reduce, reuse, and recycle" and this applies to computers too! Instead of buying additional devices for storage or media, we can repurpose our old computers for these reasons!  </li> 
                <li> If you feel you are due for an upgrade but believe that your old computer has some life in it left, donate it! If it is still functional, donate working computers to schools, charities, or organizations in need. This extends the life of the device while preventing unnecessary waste.  </li>
                <li> If you don't feel like donating, you can still sell! Selling your functional device for a discounted price not only extends the life of the device but also benefits the user as many people can benefit from a used computer.  </li>
              </ul>

                <h2> Recycle E-Waste Properly </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> When disposing of our devices instead of depending on our landfills we can take some time out of our days to find certified E-waste recycling centers. These centres take in old or broken computers to safely extract valuable materials, dispose of toxic components responsibly or find the device a new home!  </li>
                    <li>  We can also participate in company take-back programs. Over time, more companies have added these programs to recycle old devices and their components. These programs are handled by professionals who ensure proper disposal and safe recovery of materials.  </li>
                    <li> Avoid landfills! This is important because we need to remember that e-waste should never go into regular landfills as toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium can contaminate our soil and water.   </li>

                <h2> Extending the life of computers  </h2>
                <ul> 
                    <li>  When we come across an issue with our computers, most of our first instinct is to purchase a new one but instead of replacing the whole unit, we can upgrade the parts that need it. This not only improves the performance but extends the computer's life reducing e-waste. </li>
                    <li> Companies can also include a how-to guide on how to keep a computer clean, how to update software, manage storage, and much more which reduces the need for replacements. </li>
                    <li> Manufacturers can include a checklist to help users determine if they need to upgrade their computer as a whole or need to replace a specific part. This not only reduces the amount of e-waste but it reduces pollution such as plastic pollution. </li>
