                    <li> In developing areas that are rich in resources such as parts of South America or Africa are rich in resources but ar exploited for their minerals and resources. The communities in the area get little to no economic benefit while they endure the environmental and health costs of mining, manufacturing, and construction.</li>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Mining for raw materials often requires large amounts of land, meaning that the area must be cleared. This destroys ecosystems, and habitats, and adds to biodiversity loss. The species that live in these areas are often put in situations where they are in danger, death, or displaced. </li>
                    <li> Mining and construction in these areas often lead to soil erosion, fragmentation, contamination, and various other effects, endangering plant and animal life by making it difficult to survive and thrive. </li>
                    <li> Pollutants and contamination from mining, manufacturing and construction are a threat to wildlife affects their habitats and food sources which leads to sickness, population decline, and risk for extinction. </li>
