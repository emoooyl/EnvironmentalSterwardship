              <ul> 
                <li> An improper disposal of electronic devices can lead to data breaches. This happens because when our devices are improperly wiped of our data people with devious intent are able to recover the information leading to negative outcomes such as identity theft, fraud, data theft and much more. </li> 
                <li> Large companies or institutions' improperly disposed electronics pose a security risk. These electronics might contain sensitive data such as client information, cooperation data, etc., and could be exposed or sold if they end up in the hands of the wrong people.  </li>

                    <li> Computers and our other electronic devices all contain valuable materials such as metals like gold, silver, copper, platinum and more. Not only is this a loss but this creates additional mining of the materials.  </li>
                    <li> When the materials are improperly disposed of an increased demand for raw materials such as metals and components is needed meaning not only does it raise the environmental costs but it also raises the economic costs. </li>
                    <li> Without proper recycling enforcement and cycles, we are deplenishing these resources and increase negative environmental/economic increases. </li>

                    <li> Computers and general electronic devices contain toxic chemicals such as mercury, chromium, cadmium, and more and are often disposed of improperly. Over time, these chemicals contaminate water and soil.  </li>
                    <li> Effects on life. The toxic chemicals from improperly disposed electronics leaked into our soil and water sources harming humans, animals, and plants and eventually entering the food chain, which hurts ecosystems and human/animal health.  </li>
                    <li> When disposing of electronics through burning it releases harmful chemicals such as excessive carbon dioxide, lead, cadmium, and chemical fumes such as acid or other desoldering chemicals that are used to help break down the parts. </li>
