              <h2> Using Sustainable Accessories </h2>
              <ul> 
                <li> When we purchase computers, we tend to buy additional accessories such as mice, headphones, keyboards, etc. Instead of buying brand new ones, we should try to opt for hand-me-downs or previously used items. This reduces the amount of waste we create, reducing our carbon footprint. </li> 
                <li> For wireless accessories such as mice, keyboards, and more we can opt for rechargeable batteries instead of disposable ones, which not only cuts down on cost but also on waste. </li>
                <li> We can also opt for sustainable materials. We can look for accessories made from recycled or biodegradable materials such as keyboards or cases made from eco-friendly plastics or bamboo! </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Educating friends and family is one of the best ways to spread awareness about the environmental impact of computer use and the benefits of responsible practices, such as proper e-waste recycling and energy-saving habits.   </li>
                    <li>  Workplaces are also one of the largest users of computers and electronic devices, so encouraging coworkers and advocating for energy-efficient computers, proper disposal practices and e-waste recycling programs can positively impact the workplace.  </li>
                    <li>We can also encourage family, friends, and coworkers to be minimalistic when using their devices such as using the needed software, storing only necessary files, and decluttering their devices to reduce resource demands.  </li>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Companies can include packages of how to maintain a computer and how to extend its overall lifespan whether it is through including a paper package or a quick tutorial in the computer!</li>
                    <li>Companies can also include a how-to guide on how to keep a computer clean, how to update software, manage storage, and much more which reduces the need for replacements. </li>
                    <li> Manufacturers can include a checklist to help users determine if they need to upgrade their computer as a whole or need to replace a specific part. This not only reduces the amount of e-waste but it reduces pollution such as plastic pollution. </li>
